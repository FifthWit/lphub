# Rules

To compete on the leaderboard, you must adhere to the following rules. Failure to do so may result in warnings or bans depending on severity. 

## Game

- All runs must be performed on the latest release of Portal 2. Game files must not be modified in any way (things such as binary and/or .dll files).
- Launch options/commands that alter game behavior (e.g., `-tickrate`) are prohibited.
- The use of scripts, cheats, plugins, third-party software, or anything that changes the game's behavior is strictly forbidden.
- The only allowed plugin is SourceAutoRecord, and if used, it must be the latest version.

### Texture Modifications

- You may modify texture files as long as it doesn't give you any advantage.
Both `.vtf` and `.vmt` files associated with these textures can be modified.
- Models cannot be modified as they alter game behaviour.

## Runs

### Demos

- Proof of your run must be recorded using demos. To start recording, type `record <demoname>` when entering the map, or use the SAR plugin with the command `sar_record_at 0`.
- A valid demo begins when the player can move and ends when the player touches the end flags.
- For cooperative runs, both players must submit their demos.

### Console Commands & Cheats

- The use of cheats, including specific console commands, is prohibited. Even if a command is not cheat-protected, it may still invalidate your run. For a full list of banned commands, refer to [rules.portal2.sr/#command-list](https://rules.portal2.sr/#command-list).
- Additionally, commands that affect game behavior (e.g., `net_*` commands) are not allowed.

### Banned Exploits

- The following exploits are banned: freezing the game window, pause abuse, packet loss manipulation, intentional internet disconnection, and any glitches requiring setup before the run (e.g., moving portals or EHM).
- If you're unsure whether an exploit is allowed, ask in the Discord server.

## Important Note

- The moderation team has the authority to remove any record they believe to be illegitimate, and/or ban any player they believe to have broken the rules.
- If you 'accidentally' submit an illegitimate run, the moderation team will attempt to contact you, and you may receive a warning. However, ignoring their attempts to contact you, deliberately cheating, and/or receiving too many warnings may result in a ban.
- Use common sense. You must be really pathetic if you intentionally cheat on least portals of all things.
